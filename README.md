# GoingCampingGame
Personal Project

Took a text based game I originally created in C++ and am turning it into a web based game using JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS. 

Game Overview:
This game is a puzzle game with number puzzles and guessing correct items. The player must navigate through the house, completing tasks and finding the missing items she needs before her friends arrive for their weekend camping trip. The items in each room, the winning items, and the clues are randomized with each new game. The number combinations for the puzzles are randomized every time the player enters a puzzle.
